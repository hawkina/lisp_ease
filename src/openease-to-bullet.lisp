;;; This file contains all functions needed to adjust the poses and transforms
;;; from the OpenEase semantic map to the bullet world semantic map,
;;; since the kitches are slightly different and therefore the poses will be off
;;; without the usage of these functions. Also there are variations within the
;;; data representation of OpenEase and Bulelt World, these functions also take
;;; care of that.
